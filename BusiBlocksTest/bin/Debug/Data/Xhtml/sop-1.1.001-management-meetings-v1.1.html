  <h2>GUIDELINES<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <p>There are a number of scheduled and unscheduled internal and external meetings that are necessary to ensure that Sigma Bravo continues to provide quality services and deliverables and meets business management goals. These meetings are also necessary to ensure that the Sigma Bravo Management System is meeting the requirements of the organisation and to ensure that the Management Team is made aware of any potential problems or issues that may adversely affect the company.</p>
  <h2>Procedure<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <h3>Annual Business Management Review Meetings</h3>
  <p>The Managing Director will schedule a Management Review Meeting at a minimum of once every 12 months that will, amongst other things, formally review the effectiveness and suitability of the Management System and its compatibility with Sigma Bravo’s Business Policy. This meeting is a strategic meeting aimed at reflecting on management practices within the organisation. It is essential that the Management Reviews examine the Management System as it operates at all Sigma Bravo work locations.</p>
  <p>Reviews should be held more frequently if major changes to the Management System occur or are planned. Management Reviews may identify the need for major modification to procedures or additional or changed resources. Therefore it is important that all Sigma Bravo employees involved in managing aspects of Sigma Bravo operations are represented at Review Meetings.</p>
  <h3>Monthly Management Status Meetings</h3>
  <p>The Managing Director (or Mgt Del) will schedule a Monthly Management Status Meeting that will, amongst other things, formally review current projects and tasks of all employees. This meeting is intended to be an operational meeting aimed at monitoring progress on each project and addressing issues and resources in relation to each project. Monthly Management Status Meetings will also review any new or outstanding PEs raised in the Problem-Enhancement Logs (PEL) and to sign off any closed PEs.</p>
  <h3>Setting the Agenda</h3>
  <p>The Agenda for each Monthly Management Status Meeting should be determined by the Managing Director (or Mgt Del) and sent to the participants one week prior to the scheduled meeting to allow for additional items to be added if required.</p>
  <p>Important inputs into these meetings are:</p>
  <p>Project Review Forms (Form 1.1.5 Project Review Form) submitted as part of the Project Management and Control procedure (SOP 1.1.7); and</p>
  <p>Client Satisfaction Forms (Form 1.1.4 Client Satisfaction Questionnaire) submitted as part of the Project Management and Control procedure (SOP 1.1.7); and</p>
  <p>The Problem/Enhancement Log (Form 1.1.18 Problem-Enhancement Log).</p>
  <p>Other Project Review meetings should be held more frequently if they are a requirement of the project or if there are significant changes or concerns with a Client or service.</p>
  <h3>Additional Review and/or Status and/or General Meetings</h3>
  <p>Unscheduled Review or Status Meetings may be requested by any member of the Management Team. These meetings will, amongst other things, formally review current projects and tasks of all employees and any other Action Items from previous meetings or recent issues that have surfaced. Any member of the Management Team can also hold a more general meeting to discuss particular topics or issues.</p>
  <p>These meetings can be attended by any staff member invited by Management.</p>
  <h3>Client Meetings</h3>
  <p>Meetings between Sigma Bravo and the Client may be called and/or conducted at any time and requested by any party. Scheduled Client Meetings are outlined in the following SOPs:</p>
  <p>Project Initiation Client Meetings – refer to SOP 1.1.6 Project Initiation;</p>
  <p>Client Satisfaction Review Meetings – refer to SOP 1.1.7 Project Management and Control; and</p>
  <p>Project Close-out Meeting – refer to SOP 1.1.8 Project Closure.</p>
  <p>The Project Manager is responsible for scheduling, conducting and reporting on these meetings. Should there be a requirement then either the Business Manager and/or the Managing Director may attend and/or chair these meetings.</p>
  <h3>Meeting Minutes</h3>
  <p>Minutes of the meetings are to be taken by the BM or the Management Delegate (or the Project Manager for Project Review and Client Meetings). These minutes will be retained as a Business Management Record and distributed to all attendees. Minutes are to:</p>
  <p>Record the names of members attending the meeting and those tendering apologies;</p>
  <p>Record a summary of discussions in respect of each agenda item;</p>
  <p>Record actions arising from discussion, including actions from previous meetings that are still not completed; and</p>
  <p>Record the names or position titles of those nominated to take the required actions; and, where appropriate, the date by which the actions are to be completed.</p>
  <h3>Monitoring of Action Items</h3>
  <p>The MD is to review the minutes and refer action items to the persons nominated to take the required action. If considered appropriate, the MD will monitor the progress of action items through the Business Manager until satisfied that the actions have been completed.</p>
  <p>The Business Manager is responsible for adding the details for any new and changed action items from the meeting to the Problem/Enhancement Logs (PEL).</p>
