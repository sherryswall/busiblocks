  <h2>Purpose<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <p>The purpose of this Procedure is to specify requirements for scheduling and performing Internal Quality and OH&amp;S Audits of the Sigma Bravo Business Management System (BMS) to verify its maintenance, effectiveness and continual improvement.</p>
  <h2>Responsibility<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <h3>Managing Director (MD)</h3>
  <p>The Managing Director is responsible for overseeing the development, implementation and maintenance of the BMS; and conducting the related management review activities.</p>
  <h3>Quality Manager</h3>
  <p>The Quality Manager is ultimately responsible for the quality management systems operation, administration and maintenance. The Quality Manager is also responsible for the development and implementation of an Audit Program/Schedule and for selecting auditor/s.</p>
  <h3>Auditors</h3>
  <p>The Auditor in conjunction with the Quality Manager is responsible for planning, controlling, performing and producing audit reports for the specific audit/s they are undertaking.</p>
  <h3>Auditees</h3>
  <p>The Auditees are responsible for demonstrating to the Auditor an understanding of and compliance to the policies and/or procedure(s) being audited.</p>
  <h2>GUIDELINES<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <h3>General</h3>
  <p>The BMS is to be fully audited at least once each year. The person conducting the Internal Quality and/or OH&amp;S Audits should be experienced in the relevant Quality Management Systems and/or OH&amp;S Systems they are auditing, and should be as independent from the processes being audited as possible. The system may be progressively audited throughout the year.</p>
  <p>The results of audits for the previous year should be examined to identify problem areas. These areas may be scheduled for extra audits if the Managing Director believes it is warranted. Earlier audits should be scheduled for activities where significant, new or changed procedures have been implemented in order to prove their effectiveness.</p>
  <h2>Procedure<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <h3>Schedule</h3>
  <p>The Quality Manager is to prepare the Audit Program/Schedule and with the BM periodically update the Master Business Schedule to ensure that all elements of both the Quality System (as identified in the ISO9001 Standard) and the OH&amp;S System and all procedures are audited at least once during the twelve-month audit cycle.</p>
  <p>The Audit Program/Schedule is to be approved by the Managing Director and held in the office.</p>
  <h3>Preparation and Planning</h3>
  <p>A trained and competent Internal Auditor is to be appointed by the Managing Director to perform the scheduled audit.</p>
  <p>Prior to commencing the audit, the appointed Auditor is to:</p>
  <p>Review previous internal and external Audit Reports in respect of the Management System elements and/or Procedures to be audited in order to identify potential problem areas;</p>
  <p>Review the requirements of the relevant standards; and</p>
  <p>Review the relevant Procedures.</p>
  <p>Activities in respect of new or changed Procedures have been introduced are to be scheduled for early audit to prove the effectiveness of the Procedures.</p>
  <p>A copy of the relevant Procedure or clause of the standard may be used as a checklist.</p>
  <h3>Process</h3>
  <p>The purpose of the Internal Audit is to verify that documented procedures and instructions have been complied with and, as such, an Internal Audit tends to be historical in approach. The audit will be conducted at a suitably agreed time arranged by the Auditee and Auditor.</p>
  <p>The Auditor is to seek objective evidence that the BMS is being maintained and the procedures are being followed through examination of documentation, processes, work standards and Management Records. This evidence may take the form of personally sampling the relevant Management System operations, and/or by a detailed examination of all documentation and records accumulated since the last audit. Positive and negative observations are to be recorded as outlined below; these should include details of any non-conformances.</p>
  <h3>Audit outcomes</h3>
  <p>The auditor has 4 options available to provide feedback about the processes, the three that result in a Problem / Enhancement request being added to the PE Log are described below. The fourth option is to make a general comment in the audit report that cannot be related to a specific ‘issue’.</p>
  <p>Major A significant departure from documented policy, procedure or the standard that if allowed to continue, may lead to a product / service / process that does not meet specified requirements.</p>
  <p>Minor Any other significant departure from policy, procedure or the standard that in itself will not lead to a non-conforming product / service / process, but which may individually (or in aggregation with other departures) contribute to a breakdown in the BMS and which, if allowed to continue, may lead to a product / service / process that does not meet specified requirements.</p>
  <p>Observation / Improvement Deficiencies in the BMS that do not fundamentally contravene the Standard but which deserve attention should be reported in the Audit Report as an Observation. Opportunities for improvement in aspects of a conforming Management System should be reported as an Improvement Request/PEL.</p>
  <h3>Preparing the Audit Report</h3>
  <p>Following an internal audit, the Auditor is to prepare an Audit Report using the Sigma Bravo Audit Report Template. The Audit Report is to:</p>
  <p>Identify the Quality System elements and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) audited;</p>
  <p>Identify the OHS SOPs audited;</p>
  <p>Describe the objective evidence examined to verify compliance;</p>
  <p>Describe any non-conformances found and identify the associated Improvement Requests/PELs raised;</p>
  <p>Summarise the audit findings in general, i.e. whether the audit found general compliance to requirements;</p>
  <p>Report on any Observations and detail any Improvement Requests/PELs; and</p>
  <p>Recommend any follow-up action, including any additional audits seen necessary.</p>
  <p>The Audit Report is to be referred to the Managing Director for review and initiation of any necessary action, and the report is also to be referred for information to the Manager and/or Supervisor and staff working in the area that was audited.</p>
  <h3>Post-Audit Actions</h3>
  <p>Once the Managing Director has reviewed the audit report, a decision should be made as to the next course of action depending on the outcome.</p>
  <p>Where a non-conformance has been reported in the Audit Report and an Improvement Request/PEL raised, the Managing Director is to ensure that the Improvement Request/PEL is immediately actioned by taking remedial and corrective action.</p>
  <p>If there are many non-conformances, there may be a need for a follow-up audit(s). If this is the case the Quality Manager in conjunction with the Auditor, must update the Audit Program/Schedule and assist the BM to update the Master Business Schedule as required.</p>
  <p>The Managing Director is also to consider the acceptability of any Observations or Improvement Requests/PELs contained in the Audit Report and is to initiate action when a change to the BMS is seen to be desirable. The Managing Director is to follow-up on the action taken to verify its effectiveness.</p>
