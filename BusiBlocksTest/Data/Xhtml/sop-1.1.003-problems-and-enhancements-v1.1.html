  <h1>Problems and Enhancements<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h1>
  <h2>Purpose<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <p>The purpose of this procedure is to outline the process for identifying and raising corrective and preventative actions and handling enhancement or Improvement/PEL Forms. Sigma Bravoâ€™s Problem/Enhancement Log (PEL) tracks corrective and preventive actions, nonconforming products/services and enhancement or Improvement/PEL Forms. This procedure should be read in conjunction with SOP 1.1.15 Nonconforming Product/Service.</p>
  <h2>Responsibility<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <h3>Managing Director (MD)</h3>
  <p>The Managing Director (MD) is responsible for ensuring all Problems or Enhancements (PEs) are handled in accordance with this procedure and delegating PE action to the relevant SB staff member.</p>
  <h3>Management Representative (Mgt Rep)</h3>
  <p>The Management Representative (Mgt Rep) is responsible for establishing, documenting and maintaining the PELs and ensuring that this process is executed correctly.</p>
  <h3>Office Manager (OM)</h3>
  <p>The Office Manager (OM) is responsible for registering all PEs and forwarding them to the MD so that the necessary actions can be taken.</p>
  <h3>Business Manager (BM)</h3>
  <p>The Business Manager (BM) is responsible for ensuring that any actions or outstanding items from Management Meetings, Project reviews, Client surveys and Performance reviews are entered into the PEL and addressed using this procedure. The BM is to ensure that closed PEs are signed off on the PEL presented at each monthly Management Status Meeting.</p>
  <h3>Staff</h3>
  <p>All staff are responsible for raising PEs whenever they note an actual or potential problem or when they are aware of an opportunity to improve their work processes. Raised PEs should be forwarded to the Office Manager using <a href="mailto:reg@sigmabravo.com.au">reg@sigmabravo.com.au</a> for further action.</p>
  <h3>Management Delegate (Mgt Del)</h3>
  <p>The Management Delegate (Mgt Del) is the individual assigned to investigate and action the PE request by the Managing Director.</p>
  <h2>GUIDELINES<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <h3>Problems and Enhancements Overview</h3>
  <p>The Managing Director(s) or delegate will review the problems or enhancements log (PEL) every month, just prior to the Monthly Management Status Meeting. During this review, all closed and outstanding Problems or Enhancements (PEs) for the relevant period will be examined and any recommended actions on outstanding requests will be assessed. All closed PEs should be signed off in the PEL once they have been reviewed by management.</p>
  <p>There are three types of PEs that can be raised and registered in the PEL. The distinctions between them are primarily based on their objectives;</p>
  <p>Corrective Actions (Problem) are intended to determine and rectify the root cause of an identified problem. Corrective actions are always reactive and may/will include measures for preventing the problem happening again.</p>
  <p>Preventive Action (Problem / Enhancement) are intended to minimise or eliminate the possibility of a problem occurring or to create an enhancement. Preventive action is therefore proactive.</p>
  <p>Improvement (Enhancement) improvements are more than a preventive action, they are an opportunity to improve the way Sigma Bravo achieves its quality objectives.</p>
  <p>It is important to note that any corrective or preventative action taken to eliminate the cause of an actual or potential problem / enhancement should be appropriate according to the size of the problem and the risk or potential risk encountered.</p>
  <h3>Identification</h3>
  <p>Problems and Enhancements may be identified by a customer, contractor or a staff member. Examples of Problems and Enhancements include:</p>
  <p>A Sigma Bravo process/procedure has been changed which requires the relevant SOP to be updated.</p>
  <p>A problem has been identified with the loading of mapping data onto external hard drives (Project-specific PE).</p>
  <h3>Problems and Enhancement Log(s)</h3>
  <p>The Problem/Enhancement Log (PEL) is used to ensure that actual or potential deficiencies, problems or improvements are identified, analysed, documented and corrected or implemented as necessary to avoid recurrence and/or take advantage of improvements. There is one PEL to capture Sigma Bravo PEs. Complex projects may have a separate PEL to record project-specific PE Requests.</p>
  <h2>Procedure<a href="#top" class="top" alt="Back to top"></a></h2>
  <p>A problem may include any observed departure from normal procedures. A problem or enhancement may be detected or become apparent through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>An internal audit;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>An external audit;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A management or other meeting;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Customer surveys, complaints or suggestions;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Project reviews;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Staff performance reviews; and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Staff observations or suggestions.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The person observing the actual or potential problem is, without delay, to ensure that a Problem/Enhancement Request (PE) is raised, noting all details, and forwarded to the Office Manager for registering and further action.</p>
  <p>When the corrective or preventive action has been taken, the details will be entered onto the PE to show that the request is closed. The Problem/Enhancement Log will also be updated to indicate that the PE is closed.</p>
  <p>The procedure for raising and registering Improvement or Enhancement requests follows the same process described above.</p>
  <h3>Corrective and Preventive Actions</h3>
  <p>After a PE has been raised the Office Manager is to register the request in the PEL and inform the MD so that the preventive or corrective action can be taken as follows:</p>
  <p>Investigate the root cause of the problem / enhancement and record the results of the investigation;</p>
  <p>Determine the corrective/preventive action needed to eliminate the root cause of the problem / enhancement; and</p>
  <p>Arrange for the corrective/preventive action to be taken to prevent recurrence.</p>
  <h3>Improvement or Enhancement Actions</h3>
  <p>After a PE has been raised the Office Manager is to register the request in the PEL and inform the MD so that the improvement or enhancement action can be taken as follows:</p>
  <p>Investigate the improvement or enhancement suggestion and record the results of the investigation;</p>
  <p>Determine the action necessary to implement the improvement; and</p>
  <p>Arrange for the action to be taken to implement the improvement or enhancement.</p>
  <p>In taking action to determine the root cause of a problem / enhancement and prevent its recurrence (or action an Improvement/PEL Form), the MD is to delegate or seek advice and/or assistance from other members of Sigma Bravo if appropriate or necessary. All appropriate information such as processes and work operations which affect service quality, concessions, audit results, management system records, meeting minutes and client complaints are to be used to analyse and eliminate the cause of a potential problem / enhancement.</p>
  <p>Following advice that the corrective/preventive/improvement action has been completed, the MD (or delegate) is to verify that the action has been completed and is effective. If required, the MD will arrange for the amendment of Sigma Bravo documentation to record procedural or other changes resulting from the action taken.</p>
  <p>This procedure refers to the use of the Improvement/PEL Form to report problems or potential problems. The form has been designed to be multi-purpose, so that it can be used not only to report problems, but also as the vehicle for requesting, reporting and recording Corrective and Preventive Action.</p>
